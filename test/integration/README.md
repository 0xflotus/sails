# Integration tests

The goal of these tests is to run Sails just like you or I would, and verify that no anomolies have been introduced in general.

Currently, most of these tests are out of date for 0.10 and need some work.  This is a great place to jump in if you're interested in contributing!



## How Can I Help?

#### Update the existing integration tests
The integration tests need some updates so they'll pass with Sails v0.10.  Currently, they're disabled.

#### Integration test for file uploads
Because file uploads are going to be changing in the near future, it would be great to test a basic file upload using the standard Connect multipart bodyParser (e.g. http://howtonode.org/really-simple-file-uploads).  That way, any changes that are made are much easier to evaluate.
