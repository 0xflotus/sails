# How to contribute
The community is what makes Sails great, without you we wouldn't have come so far. But to help us keep our sanity and reach code-nirvana together, please follow these quick rules whenever contributing.


## Opening issues
1. If you have a question about setting up/using Sails, please check out the [Sails docs](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation) or try searching  [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sails.js).
2. Search for issues similar to yours in [GitHub search](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/search?type=Issues) and [Google](https://www.google.nl/search?q=sails+js). 
3. Feature requests are very welcome, but we would prefer to keep them separate from actual issues with the framework. If you want to submit a feature request, please read "Submitting Feature Requests" below.
4. If there's an open issue, please contribute to that issue.
5. If there's a closed issue, open a new issue and link the url of the already closed issue(s).
6. If there is no issue, open a new issue and specify the following:
  - A short description of your issue in the title
  - The sails version (find this with ````sails -v````).
  - Detailed explanation of how to recreate the issue
7. If you are experiencing more than one problem, create a separate issue for each one. If you think they might be related, please reference the other issues you've created.



## Submitting Pull Requests
0. If you don't know how to fork and PR, [follow our instructions on contributing](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/0.9/Contributing-to-Sails.md).
1. Check that someone else hasn't already starting working on your patch (i.e. [search issues and PRs](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/search?q=&type=Issues).)  There might be an open pull request, issue, or closed pull request you can reference.
2. Fork the repo.
3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need a test to ensure the patch can be quickly merged.
4. Make the tests pass and make sure you follow [our syntax guidelines](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/blob/master/.jshintrc).
5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to our [v0.10 branch](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/tree/v0.10).


## Feature Requests
We use [Trello](https://trello.com/b/cGzNVE0b/sails-js-feature-requests) for tracking feature requests.

##### Submitting a New Feature Request

1. Check to see if a feature request already exists for what you're interested in.  You can upvote and comment on existing requests.
2. [Send the board an email][sailsfeaturerequests+wlhnmobeqngolth6lh6z@boards.trello.com] with a short label (< 10 words or so) for the feature request as the subject line and a more detailed description in the body of the message with your github username.  If you'd be able to help contribute to the development of the feature, please mention that in the description!

It can sometimes take a few minutes for a new request to appear on the board, due to latency processing our little email message hack, so please be patient if you don't see it right away.
