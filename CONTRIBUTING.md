# How to contribute
The community is what makes Sails great, without you we wouldn't have come so far. But to help us keep our sanity and reach code-nirvana together, please follow these quick rules whenever contributing.


## Opening issues
1. If you have a question about setting up/using Sails, please check out the [Sails docs](http://sailsjs.org/#!documentation) or try searching  [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sails.js).
2. Search for issues similar to yours in [GitHub search](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/search?type=Issues) and [Google](https://www.google.nl/search?q=sails+js). 
3. If you want to request a feature, please do! Just make sure it's clear that you're making a feature request so we can tag it as such. (Starting the title off with "Feature Request:" helps a lot.)
4. If there's an open issue, please contribute to that issue.
5. If there's a closed issue, open a new issue and link the url of the already closed issue(s).
6. If there is no issue, open a new issue and specify the following:
  - A short description of your issue in the title
  - The sails version (find this with ````sails -v````).
  - Detailed explanation of how to recreate the issue
7. If you are experiencing more than one problem, create a separate issue for each one. If you think they might be related, please reference the other issues you've created.



## Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo.
2. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need a test!
