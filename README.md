Crud.io
------------------

Crud.io is a platform-agnostic tool for your website or cloud application that makes it easy to edit your content.
Instead of settling on a proprietary content management system like Wordpress or Drupal, Crud.io works with anything.
In fact, you can make your existing static web pages editable in only a few seconds.


General Benefits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Make your website's text, HTML, images, javascript, CSS, and other media editable

- No proprietary jargon.  You choose the name for each content node.



Designers
------------------
- Make any static HTML editable
- Design editable implementations of your mockups/wireframes using only HTML and CSS
