# Sails.js

[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/sails.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/sails)

> Sails.js makes it easy to build custom, enterprise-grade Node.js apps. It is designed to resemble the MVC architecture from frameworks like Ruby on Rails, but with support for the more modern, data-oriented style of web app development. It's especially good for building realtime features like chat.

Balderdash designs/builds scalable Node.js apps for startups and enterprise customers.  After building a few apps and taking them into production, we realized that the Node.js development landscape was very much still the Wild West.  Over time, after trying lots of different methodologies, we decided to crystallize all of our best practices into this framework.  [I](http://twitter.com/mikermcneil) hope it saves you some time :)
